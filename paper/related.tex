Yangang Cai \cite{CRQP21} compressed the depth map by AVC, HEVC, and AVS3. Their results show that using the AVS3 encoder to compress the depth maps can provide better virtual view performance and less bitrate.
Basel Salahieh \cite{BWJ21} evaluate the performance of the object-based solution. Their results show the pixel rate saving and bitrate distortion in the object-based situation.
Xavier Corbillon \cite{CSSF18} implemented a 6DoF VR application with a multi-camera system and analyzed two extreme optimal algorithms. Their results show that tiling is able to improve the service performance and the high cost for the proactive optimizing strategies
By the previous experiments, both 6DoF video quality and bitrate have a negative correlation with QP.
